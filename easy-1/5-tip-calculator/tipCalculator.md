Create a simple tip calculator. The program should prompt for a bill amount and a tip rate. The program must compute the tip, and then log both the tip and the total amount of the bill to the console. You can ignore input validation and assume that the user will enter numbers.

## Understand the Problem
- Input : user prompt for the bill amount and the tip rate
- Output : amount to tip and total bill with tip included
- Explicit Requirements : 
  - prompt for bill amount
  - prompt for tip rate
  - log tip amount
  - log total bill
  - ...
- Implicit Requirements :
  - user will enter numbers at prompts
  - ...
  - ...
- Other Rules :
  - display dollars and cents on tip amount and total bill outputs
  - ...
  - ...

## Examples / Test Cases
- // What is the bill? 200
  // What is the tip percentage? 15
  //
  // The tip is $30.00
  // The total is $230.00

## Data Structure
- Input : string (readline)
- Output : number
- Other :
  - ...

## Algorithm
1. create a 'billAmount' variable
2. create a 'tipPercentage' variable
3. prompt the user to enter a bill amount and save this value to 'billAmount'
4. prompt the user to enter a tip percentage and save this value to 'tipPercentage'
5. compute the tip amount and save it to a 'tipAmount' variable
6. compute the total bill and save it to a 'totalBill' variable
7. log the tipAmount to the console
8. log the totalBill to the console
