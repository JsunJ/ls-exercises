Build a program that asks the user to enter the length and width of a room in meters, and then logs the area of the room to the console in both square meters and square feet.

Note: 1 square meter == 10.7639 square feet

Do not worry about validating the input at this time. Use the readlineSync.prompt method to collect user input.

## Understand the Problem
- Input : user prompt (string)
- Output : number
- Explicit Requirements : 
  - prompt the user for the length of the room in meters
  - prompt the user for the width of the room in meters
  - log the area of the room to the console in both square meters and square feet
  - 
  - ...
- Implicit Requirements :
  - the user must enter room length in meters
  - the user must enter room width in meters
  - ...
- Other Rules :
  - ...
  - ...
  - ...

## Examples / Test Cases
- // Enter the length of the room in meters:
  // 10
  // Enter the width of the room in meters:
  // 7
  // The area of the room is 70.00 square meters (753.47 square feet).

## Data Structure
- Input : string (readlineSync)
- Output : number (float)
- Other :
  - ...

## Algorithm
1. declare a 'roomLength' variable
2. ask the user to enter a value and assign 'roomLength' to the value entered
3. declare a 'roomWidth' variable
4. ask the user to enter a value and assign 'roomWidth' to the value entered
5. calculate the area of the room in square meters based on 'roomLength' and 'roomWidth'
6. calculate the area of the room in square feet based on the calculated square meters
7. log the calcuated area in square meters
8. log the calculated area in square feet
